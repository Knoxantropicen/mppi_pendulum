This repository implements Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) as introduced by the paper 
[Information Theoretic MPC for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7989202/) by 
(Williams et al., 2017) and takes as forward model the pendulum OpenAI Gym environment.

The paper derives an optimal control law as a (noise-) weighted average over sampled trajectory. In particular, 
the optimization problem is posed to compute the control input such that the controlled distribution Q is pushed as close as possible to the optimal distribution Q*. This corresponds to minimizing the KL divergence between Q and Q*.
